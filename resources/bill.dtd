             Originally used for the Text <text> element, but now
             also used for the revision elements, etc.  Also removed
             <effective-date> from the %text-model; Parameter
             Entity and put it directly into the model for the Text
             <text> element, to limit where it may be used.
         c.  %processing-stages; - Contains the various stages
             through which bills and resolutions pass that may
             alter print or display.

             span of copy is not present in the document.  This
             element may be used to tag a few missing characters or
             words (horizontal missing text) or any number of
             missing lines (vertical missing text).  Typically prints
             or displays as a line of "stars" (asterisks).

	June 12 2002
	1.  Back to the original 1998 model

	June 2002  csl
	1.  Changed locator-att from IDREF to CDATA for external-xrefs
	2.  Changed optional-locator-att from IDREF to CDATA for
	external-xrefs, so parser doesn't look for a corresponding ID

	NOV 2000 REVISION (JC/MM)                       v2.3 20001102
     1. Changed xlink-type and xlink-href to xlink:type and xlink:href.

     JAN 2000 REVISION (JC/MM)                       v2.3 20000105
     Changed xml-link to xlink:type and href to xlink:href to conform
     with XLink Working Draft (Dated December 20, 1999).

     AUGUST 1998 REVISION (DAL/DJO/BTU)              v1.0 19980830
     (Changes based on information provided by the Validation
     Workshop held 13 July, 1998, as well as follow-up questions
     from that meeting.)
     1.  NEW PARAMETER ENTITY - Distinction was made between all
         types of references (%refs;) and just the external
         references (%ext-refs;).  %ext-refs; holds all
         external references (currently just one type) and is
         used (so far) in Long Title (defined in &comident.ent;).

	February 2003
	1.  Added committee-name to header

	August 2002
	1.  Changed enum from #PCDATA to %text-model;

	July 2002 ...csl
	1.  Removed <cite> as an option for header

	DEC 2000 REVISION (JC/MM)                          v2.7 20001108
     1. Changed the content model of enum to PCDATA.
     2. Removed quote element from header and official title elements,
        because quote has been added to the phrase-level model.


     NOV 2000 REVISION (JC/MM)                          v2.6 20001012
     1. Removed the enacting-clause element because it will be generated.
     2. 10/15 Added the display attribute to congress and session.

     OCT 2000 REVISION (JC/MM)                          v2.6 20001012
     1. Added display attribute to official title (official-title doesn't
        display in EH version of HRes).
     2. Added display attribute to the distribution-code and calendar
        elements.
     3. Added committee-id and amending-committee-num attributes to the
        committee-name element. The amending-committee-num controls
        the typographic display. For example: when amending-committee-num=1,
        the insertion is displayed as italic.

     SEP 2000 REVISION (JC/MM)                          v2.6 20000907
     1. Added %phrase-level to the official-title content model and
        removed fraction and %ext-refs because they are
        contained in %phrase-level;
     2. Added %phrase-level to the header content model.
     3. Added quote to official title content model

     JAN 2000 REVISION (JC/MM)                          v2.3 20000105
     1. Replaced senator and representative with nonsponsor
     2. Removed attributes from legis-num element.

     DEC 1999 REVISION (JC/MM)                          v2.2 19991213
     1. Removed linebreak from header and subheader because it was
        added to the phrase-level model which is contained by header and
        subheader.

     NOV 1999 REVISION (JC/MM)                          v2.1 19991122
     1. Added enum-in-header element to enable identification of level
        enumerators within headers. The problem is that these need
        to be cased as lowercased regardless of how the rest of the
        header is cased.

     NOV 1999 REVISION (JC/MM)                          v2.0 19991104
     1. Replaced calendar-info with calendar-num. Removed calendar-name
        and calendar-info.

        header and subheader.

     AUGUST 1999 REVISION (Joe Carmel)               v1.1 19990804
     Changes made based on Leg Branch Technical Committee
     Meeting of 7/28/1999.
     1. CHANGED ELEMENTS:
        a. the enumerator element to enum throughout
        b. the legis-num element so that the text is contained
           within the element rather than as attributes.
        c. the distribution code so that the text is within the
           element rather than as attributes.
     2. ADDED ELEMENTS:
        a. Chamber to represent "In the House of Representatives" or
           "In the Senate of the United States line.
        b. Enacting-Clause to contain the enacting clause text.
        c. Legis-type to contain "A BILL" or "AN ACT"

     AUGUST 1998 REVISION (DAL/DJO/BTU)              v1.0 19980830
     (Changes based on information provided by the Validation
     Workshop held 13 July, 1998, as well as follow-up questions
     from that meeting.)
     4.  DISTRIBUTION CODE - Added the element Distribution Code
         to this %comident.ent; and to the %form-ent; entity in
         the module %billform.ent;.  The Distribution Code
         <distribution-code> is GPO's code for the internal
         routing (distribution) of a measure.
     3.  EFFECTIVE DATE - Removed from the content models of:
           Header <header>
           Short Title <short-title>
           Subheader <subheader>
           Long Title <long-title>
     2.  LONG TITLE -  Content model used to include <effective-date>,
         <term>, and all the %phrase-level; elements.  Model was
         simplified to remove:
           Added Phrase <added-phrase>
           Deleted Phrase <deleted-phrase>
           Effective Date <effective-date>
           Internal Cross-Reference <internal-xref>
             (external is still part of <long-title>)
         Therefore model now includes the following elements
         in addition to data characters:

     Each application will have one of the following line-rule combinations
     established as a default. Line-rule output consists of combinations of
     system generated rules for the top, boxheads, end of table, verticals,
     and sides. The "hor" line-rule option inserts the top, boxheads, and
     end of table horizontal rules. Horizontal rules within the table body
     must be coded at the "row/entry" level as needed. The default line-rule
     combination may be overridden by specifying one of the following.

        line-rules      (no-gen | hor | hor-ver | hor-sides | all-gen
                         | hor-trimside | hor-ver-trimside)     #REQUIRED

     Each application will have default line-rule weight values established.
     Overrides may be specified in tenths of a point from 0 to whatever.
     The order of specification is top, bottom of boxheads, end of table,
     all other horizontals, verticals, and gap between parallel, all
     separated by periods and entered as "?.?.?...?". The example shown
     also demonstrates that to accept defaults preceding a change for
     the sixth value, the appropriate period(s) must be inserted. The
     specifications may be truncated following the last required change
     as the defaults will control the balance of the options.

     Additional space is normally allowed above and below a table in galley
     and/or page makeup. This may be eliminated by specifying "min-space",
     which removes all extra space above and below the table. The value of
     "1" will activate this override.

     Each application will have default type sizes and leading established.
     The default type sizes may be overridden by specifying a value in
     points. The "tdesc" element always defaults to two points less than
     the "ttitle" element. The "thead-tbody-ldg-size" must always be used

     Each application will have a default grid and typeface specification
     established. These may be overridden by specifying a different grid
     number based on the four grids (1-4) established for the application
     or the four alternate pi grids (5-8) and the typefaces (1-4) within
     each grid. The "grid-typeface" must always be used in combination and

     Tables will normally spread to fit within the next specified
     column/span/page/turn-page width after computing the minimum space
     needed based upon the "colspec" and boxhead (if required) justification.
     The spreading function may be overridden by specifying "actual-width",
     which will allow the table to be as close to specifications as possible.
     This function will additionally allow the table to be offset from the
     left by specifying the offset in points. The value of "1" will activate
     this override, while the value of any other number will override the
     spread plus offset the table from the left the specified amount.

     All columns must be defined in order to activate system specific
     defaults as follows:

          trace = a tracing column is a special figure column used mostly in
                  extra-wide, or parallel tables. Usually, the first column
                  of such tables contain the line or item number. Figure
                  columns default align flush right. Empty figure columns
                  default to output dot leaders.
            fig = figure column. Figure columns default align flush right.
                  Empty figure columns default to output dot leaders.
            txt = text column. Text columns default align flush and hang,
                  output dot leaders based upon required "entry" definition,
                  and spread as necessary for justification of table.
            txt-no-ldr = same as "txt" except overrides "entry" definition
                         for leaders.
            txt-no-spread = same as "txt" except does not spread for
                            justification.

                                   spread for justification.
            align-on-char = align on character. Alignment character may be
                            any character except a comma (,). This is
                            processed as a figure column with specified
                            alignments.

     All columns must have a minimum data value specified as a starting
     point for calculations to justify the table. Normal figure columns
     must be specified as the maximum number of digits that will appear
     in that column, plus an additional digit for every two commas in the
     string. An align on character column must be specified with the
     maximum digits leading the separator, the separator, and the maximum
     digits following the separator and entered as "????.??". Text columns
     must be specified as the minimum number of points required for a given
     column. The text columns will by default, spread as necessary, unless
     overridden, for justification of the table.

     Vertical rules (colsep) will by default normally be hairline rules.
     A value of "1" in the "colsep" attribute must be used to make the rule
     in the default weight. The appropriate "colsep-modify" attribute must
     also be used to change the output to a parallel or bold rule.

        colsep-modify   (parallel | bold)                       #IMPLIED

     The "align-modify-variable" attribute is a function that will override
     whatever is specified in the "align" attribute and will make the output
     center if it is no more than two lines, but will make it flush and hang
     if it is more than two lines. The value of "1" will activate this

<!-- ============================================================= -->
<!-- XML EXCHANGE TABLE MODEL DECLARATION MODULE -->
<!--  January  2004
	added:
	attribute horizontal-justify (yes | no | auto) to tbl.tgroup.att
	attribute subformat CDATA to tbl.table.att
	attributes superscript and subscript to ttitle and tdesc

	Added align-to-level attribute on table to allow for page placement depending in what 	level the table occurs		-->

<!-- Dec 20 2002
	Added attribute table-type to table name entity	-->

<!-- June 6, 2002  Modified:csl
	1.  Change the % tbl.entry.mdl to include the phrase-level entity for access to
	superscript and italic.
	2.  Added bold element "(%paracon; | %phrase-level; | bold)*"
	3.  Made optional and repeatable		-->

<!-- This set of declarations defines the XML version of the Exchange
     Table Model as of the date shown in the Formal Public Identifier
     (FPI) for this entity.

     This set of declarations may be referred to using a public external
     entity declaration and reference as shown in the following three
     lines:

     <!ENTITY % calstblx
       PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD XML Exchange Table Model 19990315//EN">
       Z %calstblx;

     If various parameter entities used within this set of declarations
     are to be given non-default values, the appropriate declarations
     should be given before calling in this package (i.e., before the
     "%calstblx;" reference). -->

<!-- The motivation for this XML version of the Exchange Table Model
     is simply to create an XML version of the SGML Exchange Table
     Model. By design, no effort has been made to "improve" the model.

     This XML version incorporates the logical bare minimum changes
     necessary to make the Exchange Table Model a valid XML DTD. -->

<!-- The XML version of the Exchange Table Model differs from
     the SGML version in the following ways:

     The following parameter entities have been removed:

     - tbl.table.excep, tbl.hdft.excep, tbl.row.excep, tbl.entry.excep
         There are no exceptions in XML. The following normative statement
         is made in lieu of exceptions: the exchange table model explicitly
         forbids a table from occurring within another table. If the
         content model of an entry includes a table element, then this
         cannot be enforced by the DTD, but it is a deviation from the
         exchange table model to include a table within a table.

       - tbl.hdft.name, tbl.hdft.mdl, tbl.hdft.excep, tbl.hdft.att
         The motivation for these elements was to change the table
         header/footer elements. Since XML does not allow element declarations
         to contain name groups, and the exchange table model does not
         allow a table to contain footers, the continued presence of these
         attributes seems unnecessary.

     The following parameter entity has been added:

       - tbl.thead.att
         This entity parameterizes the attributes on thead. It replaces
         the tbl.hdft.att parameter entity.

     Other miscellaneous changes:

       - Tag ommission indicators have been removed
       - Comments have been removed from declarations
       - NUMBER attributes have been changed to NMTOKEN
       - NUTOKEN attributes have been to changed to NMTOKEN
       - Removed the grouping characters around the content model
         parameter entry for the 'entry' element. This is necessary
         so that an entry can contain #PCDATA and be defined as an
         optional, repeatable OR group beginning with #PCDATA. -->

<!-- This entity includes a set of element and attribute declarations
     that partially defines the Exchange table model.  However, the model
     is not well-defined without the accompanying natural language
     description of the semantics (meanings) of these various elements,
     attributes, and attribute values.  The semantic writeup, also available
     from SGML Open, should be used in conjunction with this entity. -->

<!-- In order to use the Exchange table model, various parameter entity
     declarations are required.  A brief description is as follows:

     This set of declarations will use the default definitions shown below
     for any of these parameter entities that are not declared before this
     set of declarations is referenced. -->

<!-- These definitions are not directly related to the table model, but are
     used in the default CALS table model and may be defined elsewhere (and
     prior to the inclusion of this table module) in the referencing DTD. -->

<!ENTITY % titles  'title? | subtitle?'>
<!ENTITY % paracon '%pcd-model;'> <!-- default for use in entry content -->

<!--
The parameter entities as defined below change and simplify the CALS table
model as published (as part of the Example DTD) in MIL-HDBK-28001.  The
resulting simplified DTD has support from the SGML Open vendors and is
therefore more interoperable among different systems.

These following declarations provide the Exchange default definitions
for these entities.  However, these entities can be redefined (by giving
the appropriate parameter entity declaration(s) prior to the reference
to this Table Model declaration set entity) to fit the needs of the
current application.

Note, however, that changes may have significant effect on the ability to
interchange table information.  These changes may manifest themselves
in useability, presentation, and possible structure information degradation.

	DEC 2000 REVISION (DAL/DJO/BTU)              v1.0 20001227
     1. Changed the attribute changing-committee to reporting-committee
        for the added-phrase and deleted phrase elements. Changed
        the attribute type to CDATA from IDREF.


     AUGUST 1998 REVISION (DAL/DJO/BTU)              v1.0 19980830

     2.  ADDED/DELETED PHRASE CONTENT MODELS
         a.  First <effective-date> was removed from:
               <added-phrase>
               <deleted-phrase>
         b.  <effective-date> was also removed from the

             into the model for the Text <text> element, to limit
             where the date may be used.
         c.  Then the models of <added-phrase> and <deleted-phrase>
             were changed to %text-model;
     1.  ELEMENT NAME CHANGES

<!-- =============================================================
	January 2004
	Added inline-comment to after-quoted block model

	August 2003
	Added res-structure-attributes to continuation-text and
	quoted-block-continuation-text.  The attribute res-structure-attributes
	is the same as structure-attributes minus the unique-id.  Named because it
	was first used for the whereas clause in resolutions.

	July 2003
	Added quoted-block-continuation-text to quoted-block model.
	Added empty linebreak element to after-quoted-block model.
	Added pcd-model to add a marker element whereever #PCDATA is allowed.
	Added commented attribute to %structure-attributes;
	Added non-statutory-material element

	March 2003
	3/19  Added constitutional-article element to quoted-block model
	1.  Changed the header-in-text model to be the same as the header model.

	January 2003
	1.  Added subtitle and subdivision to attribute option list for level
		 on header-in-text.
	2.  Changed quoted-block model to be non-repeating, done to prohibit
		anything after the after-quoted-block element.

	and constitutional-amendment and impeachment.
	2.  Removed all references to the anomalous element.
	3.  Added attribute values to other-style for quoted-block
	archaic, hybrid, nuclear, Chapter-119, and railroad-retirement.
	4.  Added the following attribute to continuation-text:
	continuation-text-level	to identify the level to which the continuation-text
	5.  Added %structure-attributes; as an attribute on continuation-text to identify the 	level at which the continuation text is to print, continuation-text-level still 	identifies the level to which it belongs.
	6.  Removed structure-attributes from continuation-text.  belongs
	This will allow the identification of the level that the continuation-text
	is continuing, should it get separated out during the amendment process.
	7.  Changed quoted-block attribute citation to parsable-cite, same attribute used in 	external-xref

	2.  Added subdivision as an optional element within division
	3.  Added subdivision to entities %legi-structures and
	%legis-structures-attributes
	4.  Added yes-display-in-line or no-display-in-line attribute
	on quoted-block, default is "no-display-in-line".  This was needed
	to begin quotes in-line.
	5.  Removed option for anomolous from %start-of-structure.

	June 2001  Revision (csl)
	1.  Moved section element to each dtd
	2.  Moved legis-body-model to each dtd

	 FEB 2001 REVISION (JC/MM)                     v2.7 20000223
     1. Added act-name and citation attributes to the quoted-block
        element. The act-name attribute will contain the name of the Act
        or Public Law that the quoted-block is affecting. The citation
        attribute will contain the legislative "path" to the first level
        in the quoted-block. These attributes will enable the creation of
        reports that show Acts and sections affected by the measure,
        a more satisfactory "Where Am I" function, and easier
        cross-referencing between quoted-blocks.
     2. Added display-inline attribute to the text element. This allows
        us to identify the fact that section text, when followed by a
        header, does NOT appear inline. The default value is
        yes-display-inline.

     DEC 2000 REVISION (JC/MM)                     v2.7 20001208
     1. Made enum required element in all subdivision elements
     (in the start-of-structure entity).
     2. Changed the hidden attribute of legis-comments to display.
     3. Added display-inline-model attribute to subparagraph level
        and below.
     4. 12/14-Added changing-committee-number to structure attributes
     5. 12/14-Added changing attributes to the legis-body element.
     6. 12/19-Changed the section-model, subsection-model, etc. so that
              the non-structured elements come before the structured
              elements (e.g., subsection, paragraph, etc. You can't have
              a non-structured element between 2 paragraphs, it must
              be within the paragraph.
     7. 12/27-Changed the changing-committee attributes to
        reporting-committee.
     8. 12/27-Changed the content for reporting-committee to CDATA

     NOV 2000 REVISION (JC/MM)                     v2.6 20001101
     1. Changed the name of flushleft-text to continuation text.
     2. Changed the level models to allow continuation text at all
        locations, not just at the end of a series of levels. This
        is to accommodate historical material.
     3. 10/6 Added rules structures to the indent attribute.
     4. 10/7 Added resolving-type to the section-type attribute.
     5. 10/8 Removed the rules structures from the structure-attribute
             entity and created a rules-structure-attributes in the
             RULES module.
     6. 10/8 Rephrased the section-type attribute values.
     7. 10/8 Added committee-appointment-paragraph element and added it to
             the section model.


     OCT 2000 REVISION (JC/MM)                     v2.6 20001030
     1. Added rules-level-model to quoted-block
     2. Added display-inline attribute to section, subsection, and
        paragraph elements.
     3. Added section-type to section element (first-section |
        subsequent-section | non-designated-section).  This
        allows us to define explicitly whether the word before the
        section needs to be "Section", "Sec.", or nothing.
     4. Made the enum optional within the section content model only.

     MAY 2000 REVISION (JC/MM)                     v2.5 20000526
     1. Made enum and header optional in start-of-structure.


     MAR 2000 REVISION (JC/MM)                     v2.5 20000322
     1. Added legis-comment element for comments.

     FEB 2000 REVISION (JC/MM)                     v2.4 20000229
     1. Added flushleft-text element.
     2. Changed level models to include flushleft-text.

     JAN 2000 REVISION (JC/MM)                     v2.3 20000105
     1. Made %legis-structures; repeatable since they can repeat
        within a quoted-block and anomalous (the only places currently
        used).
     2. Added %nonstructured-level-model; to the quoted-block-model;
     3. Changed legis-contents tag name to toc in %start-of-structure;
     4. Created %legis-structures-attributes entity to be used with level
        attribute (see TOC).
     5. Removed up7 and down7 from the indent attribute.

     DEC 1999 REVISION (JC/MM)                     v2.2 19991213
     1. Corrected the level models so they are not ambiguous.
     2. Added a subsection-model entity.
     3. Added after-quoted-block element for the text that appears
     after the closing quote in a quoted-block. This element was
     also added to the quoted-block model.

     NOV 1999 REVISION (JC/MM)                     v2.1 19991122
     1. Changed the level models to add (text? | appropriations-para*)?)
        to the end of each of them. This was done to accommodate the
        need for flush-left text after the "main" text of the level.
     2. Added header-in-text element and attribute to enable
        appropriate casing of headers within text elements. This also
        has a level attribute that specifies the level associated with
        the element (default is section).
     3. Renamed quoted-levels to quoted-block throughout.

     NOV 1999 REVISION (JC/MM)                     v2.0 19991104
     It was determined that the generic recursive <level> model
     within sections was not as accurate as a container-based
     model with specific element names for each level (e.g., subsection,
     paragraph, etc.). As a result, various content models needed to
     be changed. In addition, it was determined that the <text> model
     did not satisfactorily accommodate levels within it and the <text>
     model was also changed appropriately. Therefore:
     1. A %nonstructured-level-model; entity was added to represent levels
        that are allowed after <text> other than the normal structure
        levels (e.g., subsection, etc.). These include graphics, tables,
        etc. (see LEGISCON.ENT)
     2. A %within-section-level-model; entity was added to represent levels
        within <section> such as subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, etc.
        (see LEGISCOM.ENT)
     3. Removed level from %legis-structures; and replaced it with
        subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, clause, subclause, item, and
        subitem.
     4. Changed the name of the attribute indent-overide to indent
        within %structure-attributes; and set possible values to be
        relative (e.g., up1, up2, down1, down2, etc.) and absolute
        (e.g., subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, etc.) in addition
        to left-margin (for left margin of page) and flush-left (for
        flush-left of the current level).
     5. Replaced level within the section content model with
        subsection | paragraph | %nonstructured-level-model;
     6. Removed %t1-model;, %t2-model;, %level-model;, and %level; and
        replaced these with specific elements for subsection, paragraph,
        subparagraph, clause, subclause, item, and subitem.
     7. Set the default style attribute to be OLC style generically and
        specifically for quoted-levels.
     8. Added legis-contents into start-of-structure entity so that
        a table of contents can appear within divisions, etc.

     SEPT 1999 REVISION (JC/MM)                     v1.2 19990901
     1. Changed the element quoted-text to quoted-levels.
     2. Changed the level-model so that graphic, table, and
        legis-contents are declared within it rather than within
        the text-model and changed the enum, header, text, so that
        level must contain either a header or text/approps-para.

     AUGUST 1999 REVISION (Joe Carmel)              v1.1 19990804
     Changed the nested-level element to level and changed the
     enumerator element to enum throughout module per the
     Leg Branch SGML Technical Committee Meeting of 7/28/99.
     1. Added quoted-text to level-model.

     AUGUST 1998 REVISION (DAL/DJO/BTU)             v1.0 19980830
     (Changes based on information provided by the Validation
     Workshop held 13 July, 1998, as well as follow-up questions
     from that meeting.)
     6.  ANOMALOUS STRUCTURE FORMAT ATTRIBUTE - Added
         "account-format" and "subsubsubaccount-format" to the
         list of values the "format" attribute of
         Anomalous Structure.
     5.  QUOTED TEXT - Allowed Quoted Text inside Quoted Text.
     4.  ACCOUNTS
         a.  An "account" in an appropriations bill is usually just
             tagged as a <title>.  Such <title>s then contain
             <subaccount>s instead of <subtitles> within them.
             Occasionally, there are appropriations <title>s that
             are NOT accounts, for example, a group of accounts
             (with a Header such as "Related Agencies") or a set
             of "General Provisions".  These would be tagged as
             regular <title>s, and an <account> element was added
             to the contents of <title> so that they can contain
             <account>s instead of <subaccount>s.
             Note: most ordinary accounts will still be tagged
             as <title>s, not as <acccounts>; the <account> tag
             is only used in special cases.
         b.  The new element <account> contains <subaccount>s.
         c.  The <subsubsubaccount> element was created to provide
             one more level down in appropriations accounts.
         d.  <account> added to %legis.structures;.
         e.  <subsubsubaccount> added to %legis.structures;.
         f.  "account-name" and "subsubsubaccount-name" added to
             the values of the "structure-name" attribute for
             Anomalous Structure.
         g.  Both "account" and "subsubsubaccount" format were
             added to the values of the format attribute for
             Anomalous Structure.
     3.  PARAMETER ENTITIES
         a.  %text-model; - Moved from this module to %legiscom.ent;
             Originally used for the Text <text> element, but now
             also used for the revision elements, etc.  Also
             deleted <effective-date> from this PE and added it
             directly to the contents of <text>.
         b.  Created new PE %style-attribute-values; to hold the
             current set of defined styles.
     2.  EFFECTIVE DATE
         a.  Moved the element from %legiscom.ent: to this module,
             since the date is now only used inside <text>.
         b.  Removed from the following content models:
               Proviso <proviso>
         c.  Deleted from %text-model; and added it directly
             to the contents of <text>.
         d.  Since %phrase-level; added <missing-copy>, that
             element is now allowed inside <effective-date>.
     1.  "style" ATTRIBUTES - added to the following elements:
         a.  Title <title>, since Titles are frequently printed
             in a style that is not the same as the whole measure
         b.  Subtitle <subtitle>, since Subtitles are frequently
             Titles in another measure, copied into this measure
         c.  Modified for the Quoted Text element to allow an
             "other" as a value to "style" and to add an
             "other-style" attribute, to name or explain the
             this "other" value.

     July 30 2002  csl
	1. Corrected typo subtite-container changed to subtitle-container

	June  2002	csl
	1. Corrected typographical error title-lowest-boded to title-lowest-bolded

	July 2001 csl
	1.  Changed quoted-entries to toc-quoted-entry
	2.  Added US Code toc structure to accommodate multi column tocs.

	DEC 2000 REVISION (JC/MM)                       v2.5 20001108
     1. Changed possible attribute values for the toc element so
        they are not in conflict with one another to make it
        XML compliant.

     JUNE 2000 REVISION (JC/MM)                      v2.4 20000619
     1. Removed pagenumbers attribute on toc.
     2. Changed level attribute on toc to lowest-level.
     3. Added container-level attribute to toc element. This defines the
        element the toc is for. For example, it's the toc for the
        legis-body.
     4. Added bold attribute to toc-entry
     5. Changed possible values of lowest-bolded-level in toc element to
        division, title, subtitle, or none.

     JANUARY 2000  REVISION (DAL/DJO/BTU)            v2.3 20000105
     1. Changed legis-contents element name to toc. The toc element was
        simplified at this point to use generic <toc-entry> and
        <quoted-entries> rather than separate tag names for each level of
        the legislative document (e.g., division, part, etc.).
        Also, five attributes were created for the toc element for
        further processing.
        A. The pagenumbers attribute (YES or NO) will determine if
        composition needs to add page numbers to the output.
        B. The quoted-block attribute (YES or NO) lets the application
        (editor) know whether or not to create the TOC with quoted-block
        material.
        C. The level attribute tells the application which level to display
        through. For example, section would include all levels above section
        (e.g., division, chapter, etc.) and include sections, but not
        subsections, paragraphs, etc.
        D. The regeneration attribute tells the application whether or not
        to regenerate the TOC on closing the document.
        E. The lowest-bolded-level tells composition which levels to
           bold through (e.g., subtitle).

        The model for toc-entry is identical to the model for header.
        quoted-entries (with the style attribute) is a container
        for when quoted-block material is included in the TOC and pulls the
        appropriate style attribute with it.

        As a result of this, the following twelve elements were removed:
                division-entry, title-entry, subtitle-entry,
                chapter-entry, subchapter-entry, part-entry,
                subpart-entry, account-entry, subsubaccount-entry,
                subsubsubaccount-entry, section-entry, and
                legis-entry-text.
        The %legis-entry-model; entity was also removed.

        The call to contents.ent was removed because the two elements
        defined in contents.ent (page-num and contents-annotation) are
        no longer needed.

     AUGUST 1998 REVISION (DAL/DJO/BTU)              v1.0 19980830
     (Changes based on information provided by the Validation
     Workshop held 13 July, 1998, as well as followup questions
     from that meeting.)
     2.  NEW ELEMENTS
         a.  Created two new elements  <account-entry> and
             <subsubsubaccount-entry>.
         b.  Added <account-entry> and
             <subsubsubaccount-entry> to content model of
             LEGIS-CONTENTS.
     1.  EFFECTIVE DATE - Removed from Legislative Table Of Contents

     DEC 1999 REVISION (JC/MM)                      v2.2 19991213
     1. Added a pre-form-model and pre-form container which
        contains several optional elements similar to those in the bill form:
        author-note, running-header, legis-counsel, associated-doc,
        signature-line, first-page-header, and first-page-date.
     2. Changed the default value of the role attribute in associated-doc to
        "associated-bill"

     NOV 1999 REVISION (JC/MM)                      v2.0 19991104
     1. Changed the order in the content model for form-model to
        match the order in Introduced Bills.
     2. Changed enacting-clause to be optional because it doesn't exist
        in resolutions.
     3. Replaced calendar-info with calendar, thus combined calendar-name
        and calendar-num into a single element.

     SEPT 1999 REVISION (JC/MM)                      v1.2 19990901

     2. Changed element long-title to official-title.
     3. Changed chamber to current-chamber.

        rather than optional (commas versus ors).

     (Changes based on Leg Branch SGML Technical Committee Meeting of
     July 28, 1999
     1. NEW ELEMENTS:
        a. Chamber to represent the body (House or Senate) within the bill.
        b. Enacting-Clause to contain the text of the enacting clause.

     Workshop held 13 July, 1998, as well as follow-up questions
     from that meeting.)
     4.  MOVED ELEMENTS:
         a.  Moved Distribution Code to the module %comident.ent
             since Bills, Resolutions, and Amendments all
             use the element.
     3.  NEW ELEMENTS:
         a.  Associated Document <associated-doc> (replaces
             Associated Bills, Associated Reports, Legislative
             History, etc.)
         b.  Distribution Code <distribution-code> GPO's code
             for the internal routing (distribution) of a measure.
